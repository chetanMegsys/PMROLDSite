                                “Growth” could be a way of life even at the time of economic downturn. Maintenance of a company’s financial health is the factor that decides if the firm will be losing out on market share during the crisis or will convert the same crisis into opportunity. Every company, irrespective of its size, has a right to try out every means for achieving their growth targets with regards to revenue and profitability.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                Starting on a good note is simple, but sustaining the same goodness is a horrendous task. This applies to enhancing the ability of the companies/clients to innovate, grow vertically, reducing overheads, and last but not the least – be in the good books of customers. At the same time, retention of existing customers coupled with addition of new customer’s needs to be on the anvil. The operational efficiency, in a nutshell, could be increased by amalgamating pleasant and not-so-pleasant experiences in line with simplification and standardization.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Making a note of organizational strengths and opting for some work culture changes would certainly be challenging for majority of companies/clients. In this scenario, the companies/clients need to have proper data in hand so that measuring and monitoring the changes could be done smoothly.

                                Management of performance and financials in one go is vital for every company/client to figure in the list of “profitable” ones. Where competition is fierce, businesses can’t help but plan and cross atleast the “satisfactory” mark in terms of profitability. Herein, once the businesses catch hold of the factors that are certain to drive profitability, managers could devise strategy revolving around them.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Raising sales volume</li>
                                    <li>Reducing unit costs</li>
                                    <li>Minimizing overheads per unit of sale</li>
                                    <li>Increasing sales price</li>
                                </ul>
                                An interesting thing to note is that the drivers mentioned above also turn out to be the issues that do impact the company’s monetary performance on direct basis.

                                Marketing could be categorized as multichannel or digital coupled with improved customer interaction. Moving with the reality that customers are more empowered than the marketers these days, the marketers need to play on the pulse of customers – be it the digital way (by digital commerce and social analytics) or through sales through brick and mortar stores. Customer interactions are not confined to merely having the customers’ feedback but also having their needs registered. Persistence Market Research plays the devil’s advocate herein, so that both – the customers and companies end up being on the same page.
