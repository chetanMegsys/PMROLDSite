                                Marketing could be categorized as multichannel or digital coupled with improved customer interaction. Moving with the reality that customers are more empowered than the marketers these days, the marketers need to play on the pulse of customers – be it the digital way (by digital commerce and social analytics) or through sales through brick and mortar stores. Customer interactions are not confined to merely having the customers’ feedback but also having their needs registered. Persistence Market Research plays the devil’s advocate herein, so that both – the customers and companies end up being on the same page.
