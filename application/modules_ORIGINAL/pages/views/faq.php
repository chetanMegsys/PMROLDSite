                                    Persistence Market Research does provide data for public viewing, but it is restricted to the gist of that market report, which is inclusive of executive summary, analyst briefing, press release, and report description. Providing entire research data is not feasible in the monetary as well as intellectual interests. As you all know, several days (at times, even weeks) are spent by our analysts in bringing the relevant and precise data on the table. This investment needs to be safeguarded, as our analysts are our intellectual property.
