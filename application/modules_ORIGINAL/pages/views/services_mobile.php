This assessment of performance implies checking if the company’s operations and product offerings are in sync with market opportunities. Capitalizing on these opportunities could be done later.

Maintenance of a company’s financial health is the factor that decides if the firm will be losing out on market share during the crisis or will convert the same crisis into opportunity. Every company, irrespective of its size, has a right to try out every means for achieving their growth targets with regards to revenue and profitability.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                Starting on a good note is simple, but sustaining the same goodness is a horrendous task.

Herein, once the businesses catch hold of the factors that are certain to drive profitability, managers could devise strategy revolving around them.

                                </ul>
